  This program requires Java 2 v1.3 to run.  It can be run from
the command line like this:

java -jar bin/LinkChecker.jar http://www.yahoo.com -d4000

  This will load Yahoo's home page, and will start checking that all
the links from it work.  It will then load every page on www.yahoo.com
that it finds links to, and check them too.  To avoid overloading the
server there is a 4 second delay between each link.
  To see more of what it is doing use -b.  If you have a sample of your
website on your computer, and no connection to the internet you could
use this command to check it:

java -jar bin/LinkChecker file:///home/user/webpages/index.html -l

  The -l stops it from checking pages that are not on the same server
as the first page.

Ant
  The program can also be run from Ant.  To do this you need to set up
the task like this:

  <taskdef name="checklinks"
        classname="uk.co.matthewwest.LinkChecker.LinkCheckerTask"
        classpath="/path/to/LinkChecker.jar"/>

Then you can call it like this

  <checklinks href="http://localhost.localdomain/index.html"
	      delay="200" local="no" />

  The program uses an XML parser to read the webpages, and therefore
only works on well formed HTML, more details can be found at
www.w3c.org/.  There are some DTD's built into the .jar file, however
if they are not there it will need to look on the internet for them.
